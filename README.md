The Idea of this project it to tell a story through code
We do that by mixing  a couple of quick storytelling processes together https://www.google.com/search?q=Storyboard&num=20&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQ1_mu2bHUAhVG8mMKHSCNCeYQ_AUICigB&biw=1150&bih=961#imgrc=lFRTudtEE1UO_M:
We are mixing Blake Synders Beat Sheet concept https://timstout.wordpress.com/story-structure/blake-snyders-beat-sheet/
We are also mixing Pixars' Once Upon a Time: Pixar Prompt http://thewritepractice.com/once-upon-a-time-pixar-prompt/
When we realate all of this to Code we get story code

For this project I was trying to build out the Beta, With a story called Beta.
